3. You will need to install a few file for functionality. In your terminal: touch .gitignore .env<br>
4. Add node_modules and .env to your .gitignore file<br>
5.You will need an API key for Lexigram<br>
6.Create the database and migrate the models into it by running the following commands:<br> sequelize db:migrate<br>
7.Run the nodemon and navigate to localHost:3000 in your browser and you are all set! Enjoy!<br>

# User Story
As a user, I want to log into my profile and search for the presented symptom<br>
As a user, I want to see a response of what the disease the patient could be suffering from<br>
As a user, I want to be able to update patient symptoms<br>
As a user, I want an opportunity to delete the user if they are cured<br>

# MVP Goals
-adding API<br>
-Use RESTful routing<br>
-Utilize an ORM to create a database table structure and Interract with the data<br>
-deployed online and accessible to the public<br>
-DRY HTML, CSS, and back-end code




# stretch goals
Add medication table<br>
Keeping track of the desease and how many people are suffering from that desease <br>
Styling the app to look nicer


# potential roadblocks
-Correct routing <br>
-Proper database <br>
-Relationships/associat btn user, products and reviews<br>
-connecting backend<br>
-dropping databases<br>
-destructuring <br>
-Middleware<br>
-EJs<br>
